    "The selected gridpoint SAUD (22.1N;50.8E) corresponds to desert in Saudi Arabia. Su et al. 2006 [1] shows detected breakpoints in their Figure 2 using two different tests. For the selected gridpoint they find a breakpoint at the start of 1998 (t3,4) and another one halfway 2002 (t4,5) using alpha=0.01 for both tests. As can be seen below, the dataset contains several periods with missing data. We get rid of these missing data through resampling to monthly means as is done in Su et al. 2006. \n",
